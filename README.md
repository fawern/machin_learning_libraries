# Machine Learning Algorithms

In the classification.py and regression.py files, you can find the implementations of various machine learning algorithms.
These algorithms can automatically search for the best hyperparameters and outputs of all algorithms when called from the main.ipynb file.
By providing the test and training datasets, you don't need to write all the algorithms individually to find the most suitable one for your dataset.
This significantly simplifies the process of finding the optimal algorithm for your specific dataset.
